## Project overview

The goal of the project is to use Physics Informed Neural Networks to learn the dybamics of a vibrating tissue.

The following steps have been carried out to complete the task:

- ### Mathematical Formulation  
  Model and normalize the Partial Differential Equation representing the physical phenomenom;
- ### Constraints and External Force
  Represent the expressions of the hard constraints, i.e. the boundary conditions, to whom the PDE is subject and the external force acting on the membrane;
- ### Neural Network Architecture
  Choose an architecture to build the PINN. We compared a simple MLP, an MLP with Random Weight Factorization (RWF) and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN);
- ### Data validation
  We validated the predictions of the networks by comparing them to an ideal membrane deformation built using Matlab's pde solver.

## How to run the code

To start a training, run  
```bash
python main.py [network] [activation function] [training setup] [optional: regularization]
```
with:
- network = __MLP__ || __RWF__ || __KAN__
- activation function = __tanh__ || __relu__ || __silu__
- training setup = __setup1__ || __setup2__
- regularization (use this only if training a KAN) = __noreg__ || __eff_reg__ || __orig_reg__

When the training is complete, the model will be saved in __/training/{model_name}_{index}/model__.  
Then:
1. Run __prediction.ipynb__, the predictions of the network will be saved in  
__/matlab/only_damp/matlab_evaluations/predictions_csv_files/{model_name}_{index}/predictions.csv__.  
You can generate a different mesh by changing and running __/matlab/only_damp/pde_only_damp_ideal.m__
2. Run __/matlab/only_damp/matlab_evaluations/single_eval.m__, specifying __{model_name}_{index}__.
It will save into __/matlab/only_damp/matlab_evaluations/{model_name}_{index}__ a gif with the predicted membrane oscillation.
3. Run __/matlab/only_damp/matlab_evaluations/membrane_error.m__.  
It will save into __/matlab/only_damp/matlab_evaluations/{model_name}_{index}__ a gif with the difference between the ideal and the predicted oscillation, along with the plots of the error with respect to the ideal solution.
